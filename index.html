            My name is Alan Mistê, currently I live in Germany, I have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Systems, I can speak and write in three languages Kurdish, Arabic, and English, and currently I am learning German.
            I like programming so I always try to learn something new within the programming field, and I also like photography, design, and drawing, blogging and anything related to the technical side.

            I worked for four years in the technical support department at the Health Directorate in Al-Hasakah, Syria.
            I quit my job due to immigration, after residing in Germany I took an online course in web development offered by Udacity. I also took an online course in technical support provided by Google on the Coursera platform and now I have a further education course by Startsteps in web development field.

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
